## Product Team/Squad

  * Goal: migrate pipelines from Jenkins to GH Actions - progress: 76% :green_circle:
* OKRs:
  * Decrease time to reroute path from 1h to 30 minutes - progress: 15% :green_circle:

## Bonus Hangar Achievements
* Increased code coverage from 80% to 90%
* Aligned repositories with AA GH standards (CODEOWNERS, protected branches, and aa.yml in place)
* Got developers scanning code locally before PRs

## Friction Log
* Item: Summer Code Freeze
  * Blocking: Squad cannot push any code to production
  * Action taken: Requested exception for squad while in Hangar
* Item: Developers cannot scan code locally
  * Blocking: Knowing code is ready before PR
  * Action taken: VS Code integration with scanning tool setup for each dev

## Aftercare
* Clean up old Jenkins files from repos once migrated
* Check in that any new scrum ceremonies are still taking place with required attendees (retro, refinement, etc)
